Need to wrap these methods in JuliaExecutor::Submit():
- Setup() 
- SetupPartials()
- ExtractIOMetadata()
- ExtractPartialsMetadata()
- ComputePartials()
- SetOptions()
- GetJuliaFunction() - actually this is called FROM other methods, so it's implicitly wrapped

All these are currently being called from gRPC worker threads.
